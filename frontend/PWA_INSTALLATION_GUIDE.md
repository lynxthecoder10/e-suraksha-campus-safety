## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this a real native app?**
A: E-Suraksha is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides a native-like experience using modern web technologies. It works like a native app but doesn't require app store installation. This means faster updates, cross-platform compatibility, and no app store approval delays.

**Q: Will it work without internet?**
A: Yes! Core emergency features (SOS alerts) work offline. Alerts are queued locally and sent automatically when connection returns. Your session also persists offline, so you stay logged in.

**Q: Does it use a lot of data?**
A: No, the app caches content efficiently. After initial load (typically 5-10 MB), only new data is downloaded. Offline mode uses zero data. Background sync is minimal and efficient.

A: Yes, but installation process differs. Use Safari and tap Share button, then "Add to Home Screen". Note: iOS has some PWA limitations compared to Android (no automatic install prompt, limited background sync).

A: No, location is only accessed when you trigger an SOS alert. No continuous tracking occurs. You have full control over location permissions. Location sharing stops when alert is resolved.

**Q: Will I stay logged in?**
A: Yes! Your session persists for 24 hours. You can close the app, restart your phone, and still be logged in when you reopen it. Session is cached securely on your device.

**Q: What happens if I clear my browser data?**
A: Clearing browser data will log you out and remove cached content. You'll need to log in again, but your account data on the server is safe. Only local cache is affected.

**Q: Can I install on multiple devices?**
A: Yes, you can install and use E-Suraksha on multiple devices. Each device will have its own session. Sessions are independent and can be active simultaneously.
